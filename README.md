## Planning

The main users are expected to be people who are seeking information and guidance about mental health. this will be people who are suffering from mental health problems or people who are concerned about there loved ones. The site should have a comprehensive array of information and guidance.

### Wireframe

The website was changed between planning and release. this was done since there were problems with the planned layout which were found after the website was developed.

## Development

The website was developed using HTML & CSS with the bootstrap framework.

There was also some JS used to add the dark mode switch and add a smooth animation when using links within pages.

A project board was set up and used during development.

a github repo was used for version control.

The website uses thorough customization of styling for the bootstrap classes.

The home page was created first and this was used as template for the other pages. During development of the home page it became apparent that the wireframe design was going to be too busy so the design was changed.

An AI was used to generate the sites content and assist in development. particularly to automate repetitive tasks like filling in several cards with content.

## Testing

The website was thoroughly tested before completion.

- Manual code review to find bugs
- Manual code review to check accessability requirements eg. alt text on images
- check site with W3S HTML/CSS validator
- All links work and external links open in a new tab
- Manually test site locally. for example, rendering issues, images loading, navigation links, scale at breakpoints, check console for errors in dev tools, etc.
